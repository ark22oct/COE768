# Computer Networks
Lab work for Computer Networks accomplished using C. Feel free to reference, but avoid copying.

Concentrates on the Internet technology. It first introduces the OSI and TCP/IP network architecture models. It then studies the implementation principles and design issues at each layer of these models. Topics include: OSI and TCP/IP models, data transmission basics, data-link protocols, local area networks, wide-area networks, Internet structures, TCP/IP protocol suite, and application Layer protocols. Laboratory work focuses on the implementation of stop-and-wait protocol based on the BSD socket. In addition, we will gain practical experience by building and studying a physical network using network devices such as switches and routers.

# Project (Peer to Peer Network and Index Server) Overview

Revolves around the development of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) application with an index server and multiple peers exchanging content. The communication between the index server and peers utilizes UDP, while content download occurs over TCP.
